<p>Clearly, there has been an increasing use of neural network based inference integrated with current artificial skin sensors in various applications ranging from robotics to health monitoring. However, due to a lack of on-skin compute, current skin sensors have to rely on off-body computers such as phones and cloud servers, for compute. This causes a significant slowdown in real time response.</p>
<p>For instance, for a person with a prosthetic arm, on-skin neural network compute can enable data from the skin-on interface integrated with his/her haptic arm to respond to touch, pressure, heat etc in real-time. We thus see a need for a fast, low-power on-skin AI compute engine (neural network accelerator) to be integrated with current artificial skins. In addition, the on-skin AI compute engine has to be highly configurable, so it can run diverse neural networks, and support multiple applications.</p>
<p> We developed AI-on-skin - a wearable artificial skin interface integrated with a neural network hardware accelerator that can be reconfigured across diverse neural network models and applications. AI-on-skin is designed to scale to the entire body, comprising tiny, low-power, accelerators distributed across the body. </p>
<p>We built a prototype of AI-on-skin that covers the entire forearm (17 by 10 cm) based on off-the-shelf FPGAs.Our electronic skin based prototype can perform (a) handwriting recognition with 96% accuracy, (b) gesture recognition with 95% accuracy and (c) handwritten word recognition with 93.5% accuracy.
